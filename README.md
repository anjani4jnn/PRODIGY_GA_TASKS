# PRODIGY INFOTECH GENERATIVE AI INTERNSHIP TASKS
## Projects Overview
### TASK1:TEXT GENERATION WITH GPT2 CREATED USING GOOGLE COLAB
**Description:**
To Train a model to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt. Starting with GPT- 2, a transformer model developed by OpenAl, you will learn how to fine-tune the model on a custom dataset to create text that mimics the style and structure of your training data.
### TASK2:IMAGE GENERATION WITH PRE-TRAINED MODELS CREATED USING DALL.E MINI BY CRAIYON.COM
**Description:**
To Utilize pre-trained generative models like DALL-E-mini or Stable Diffusion to create images from text prompts.
**What I did:**
I used Hugging Face's DALL.E-mini by craiyon.com and created images on a text prompt "a futuristic cityscape at sunset, with flying cars and neon lights".
### TASK3:TEXT GENERATION WITH MARKOV CHAINS CREATED USING GOOGLE COLAB
**Description:**
To Implement a simple text generation algorithm using Markov chains. This task involves creating a statistical model that predicts the probability of a character or word based on the previous one(s).
